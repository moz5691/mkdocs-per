# MkDocs for tech notes


## Usage

I have struggled to get Poetry working on Python 3.10.x.
I think the reason was I have installed Poetry with Python 3.9.x and upgraded to 3.10.x

Run the following in Python virtual environment if you run into a trouble to run ```poetry```.
```shell
pip install cleo tomlkit poetry.core requests cachecontrol cachy html5lib pkginfo virtualenv lockfile
```
